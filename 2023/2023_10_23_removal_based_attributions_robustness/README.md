**Abstract:**
We continue with the theme of adversarial XAI, evaluating explanations and assessing their robustness. 
Last Monday, our focus was primarily on gradient-based explanations, while my presentation will be on removal-based feature attribution methods, such as SHAP or LIME. 
I’ll go through the proposed theoretical characterization of the robustness of these methods, which focuses on both stability under input and model changes. 
I will also describe performed experiments to validate theoretical results and demonstrate the practical implications of the paper’s findings.
