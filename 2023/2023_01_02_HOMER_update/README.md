## HOMER update

**Abstract:** We will summarize the work of the last 3 months in the HOMER project.
We will try to answer questions:

:bulb: In what direction did our research in the area of AutoML and XAI go?

:bulb: Did we stick to the established plan? However, did we need to change something?

:bulb: Did any new research topics come up?

:bulb: Did all review responses go to reviewers?

:bulb: Is it worth the time commitment for physicians?
