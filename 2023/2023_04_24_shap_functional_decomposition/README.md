# Shapley values and functional decompositions

**Based on:**
- Munir Hiabu, Joseph T. Meyer, Marvin N. Wright. ***Unifying local and global model explanations by functional decomposition of low dimensional structures***
- Sebastian Bordt, Ulrike von Luxburg. ***From Shapley Values to Generalized Additive Models and back.***


**Abstract:** 
Another presentation on Shapley Values? But what an interesting one! (At least, I hope so.)

We will refer to Shapley Values from a completely different angle -- discussing an article that shows a new perspective on these explanations, not at all related to game theory. Namely, the authors propose a global representation of the model through its functional decomposition into a sum of main and interaction components. This allows unifying local explanations with the global explanation of the model and has many more advantages that we will discuss.

We will also concern about the possibilities of further research development in this area, which is connected to another paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04012) proving that every SHAP-value function corresponds to a specific functional decomposition.
