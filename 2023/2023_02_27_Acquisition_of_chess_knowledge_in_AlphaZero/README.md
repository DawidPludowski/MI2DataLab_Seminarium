## Acquisition of chess knowledge in AlphaZero

**Abstract:** Understanding the inner workings of extremely complex deep learning models with human or even superhuman behaviors poses not only a huge challenge, but can also be a source of knowledge we have yet to discover. One such example is AlphaZero - a neural network engine that learns chess solely by playing against itself, and ultimately beats the best chess players and engines in the world. What can we learn from such a system? Does its learning process in any way reflect how we humans have learned to play chess over the centuries? Does it look at chess in any way similar to us, or is it completely disconnected from our understanding of this game? I will show you some of the results of the Acquisition of chess knowledge in AlphaZero paper, so that you can decide by yourself.
