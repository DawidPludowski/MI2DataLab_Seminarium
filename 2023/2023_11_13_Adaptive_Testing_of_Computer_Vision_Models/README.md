# Adaptive Testing of Computer Vision Models

Vision models often fail systematically on groups of data that share common semantic characteristics (e.g., rare objects such as stop signs covered in snow), but identifying these cases of failure poses a challenge. At the same time having knowledge about them provides valuable insight on how to improve models (e.g., by collecting more labeled data of this kind). This week week during the seminar we will explore the AdaVision process which helps users discover, group, and fix different failure modes of Computer Vision models with the help of LLMs. We will study how the proposed framework is designed, look at examples, and compare this human-in-the-loop approach with automatic methods. The presentation will be based on [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02774) paper.
