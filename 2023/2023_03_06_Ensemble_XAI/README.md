## Ensemble explanations in image classification

**Abstract:** Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods form a large portfolio of different algorithms. Although the main goal of all of explanation methods is to provide an insight into the decision process of AI system, their underlying mechanisms may differ. This may result in very different explanations for the same tasks. In this presentation, I will present approaches that aims at combining several XAI algorithms into one ensemble explanation mechanism. Moreover, I will show some metrics that quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate explanations. (from <em>Bobek, S., Bałaga, P., & Nalepa, G. J. (2021). Towards Model-Agnostic Ensemble Explanations.
