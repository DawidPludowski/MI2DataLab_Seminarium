# Adaptive Testing and Debugging of NLP Models

Unlocking the true potential of Language and Learning Models (LLMs) is no simple feat. The journey to identifying and addressing bugs within these intricate systems is often marred by complexity. While checklists aimed at unearthing potential vulnerabilities do exist, they fail to cater to the idiosyncrasies of each individual model. Enter AdaTest: a captivating, interactive process that combines the prowess of generative models with the art of unit testing. This transformative approach empowers users to create bespoke tests that unleash the full potential of their LLMs. Furthermore, by utilizing a sophisticated debugging loop, users can seamlessly rectify issues and safeguard against the introduction of new bugs. Brace yourself for a riveting exploration of this dynamic dance between developers and NLP models, as they collaborate to achieve greater perfection and eliminate the elusive gremlins that impede progress.
