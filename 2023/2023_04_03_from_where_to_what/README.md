# From "Where" to "What": Towards Human-Understandable Explanations through Concept Relevance Propagation
Local XAI methods only explain prediction in the sense of an attribution map, which tells us where important features are but don't tell us what those features are. In contrast, Global XAI methods visualize concepts the model has learned but don't tell us where they are located. The Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP) approach combines the local and global views on XAI, which allows it to answer questions related to "where" and "what". During the seminar, I will introduce how CRP works and how to use it for model analysis. Then we will go into experiments concluded in the article.
