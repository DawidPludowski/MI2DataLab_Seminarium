## Ensembles of models - how to get the most benefits

**Abstract:** Model ensembles have been discussed for a long time. One example is the random forest that we are familiar with, which is an ensemble of up to several hundred trees. However, in the field of AutoML, model ensembles are often understood as a combination of the most various algorithms. During the presentation, we will show how to build model ensembles and which methods allow you to increase the benefits of using model ensembles. The base articles of this presentation are the core of most of the work in AutoML, and are written by Rich Caruana.
