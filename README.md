## Year 2022/2023

### Fall semester

#### Upcoming presentation

**2022-10-24 - overview: MAIR**

**Abstract:** Monitoring of AI Regulations (MAIR) started as a project focusing on language analysis of policy documents regarding AI. As the NLP for policy analysis is young research field, one of the main project goals is development of such methods and testing them on various use cases, with support of policy experts. During the seminar we will present our four main streams of work. We will start with motivations of all projects, then we’re going to talk about our approaches to document analysis, including clustering of embeddings, different ways of topic modeling and argument mining. At the end we will present our plans for future work.
