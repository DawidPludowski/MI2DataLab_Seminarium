* 2022-10-10 - overview xLungs

***Abstract:** During the seminar, we are going to introduce you to all of our 4 “tasks” in the xLungs project. We are going to address problems related to the collection of our datasets, which consisted of acquiring data from hospitals and later anonymization of that data. We will be talking about our methods for segmentation of human organs, and vector representation of lungs (using segmentations and autoencoders). Other problems which are going to be presented are the classification of lung abnormalities and the fairness of those models. We will briefly talk about the preparation of ontology with help from our Radiologists and how they annotate data. At last, we are going to talk about DevOps and our application.*
