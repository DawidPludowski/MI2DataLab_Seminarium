# FLIRT: Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming

As generative models become available for public use in various applications, testing and analyzing vulnerabilities of these models has become a priority. In this paper, the authors propose FLIRT: an automatic red teaming framework that evaluates a given model and exposes its vulnerabilities against unsafe and inappropriate content generation. Contrary to the currently available solutions, FLIRT fully automates the feedback loop responsible for offensive content generation and does not follow a human-in-the-loop approach. The experiments demonstrate that compared to baseline approaches, the proposed strategy is significantly more effective in exposing vulnerabilities in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, even when the latter is enhanced with safety features.
