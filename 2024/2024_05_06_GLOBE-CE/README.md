# GLOBE-CE: A Translation-Based Approach for Global Counterfactual Explanations

The major drawback of counterfactual explanations lies in their incapacity to extend beyond the local or individual level. Although some research explores the concept of a broader explanation, only a few offer frameworks that are both dependable and computationally manageable. On the seminar on Monday we will be discussing the paper proposing Global & Efficient Counterfactual Explanations (GLOBE-CE), a flexible framework that tackles the reliability and scalability issues associated with current state-of-the-art. The authors also provide unique mathematical analysis of categorical feature translations and experimental evaluation showing that GLOBE-CE performs significantly better than the current methods across multiple metrics.
