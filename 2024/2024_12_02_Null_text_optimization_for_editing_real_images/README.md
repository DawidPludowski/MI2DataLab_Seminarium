# NULL-Text Inversion for Editing Real Images Using Guided Diffusion Models

## Abstract

During this seminar, we will talk about image editing using text-guided diffusion models. The important step of this process is to invert the image which can be done in multiple ways. I will present one of the most promising ones - NULL-Text Inversion - presented on CVPR 2023. The authors break the process into two parts: pivotal inversion and NULL-text optimization. The latter uses the well-known DDIM method as the anchor for optimization. I will explain both steps, their advantages over other methods and the use case for these techniques. Additionally, we will see how elements of the prompt are connected to the parts of the image.

The presentation will be based on this paper: [Null-text optimization](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Mokady_NULL-Text_Inversion_for_Editing_Real_Images_Using_Guided_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html).
