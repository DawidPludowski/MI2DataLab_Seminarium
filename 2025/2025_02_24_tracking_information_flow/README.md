# Tracking informations flow in biosystems from high-throughput data

Biology investigates ones among the hardest systems to model, due to
their sheer complexity, but also tight coupling and multi-modality of
their components. Even the acquisition of data is highly challenging,
often leading to under-determination and the lack of precision and
isolation.

In my talk, I will present Vistla, an information-theory based tool for
tracking how information injected by experimental intervention
percolates through a complex system. The method solves a higher-order
widest path problem using interaction information as a score under data
processing inequality constraints. The resulting flow tree can be used
to aid forming hypotheses about the system's mechanics.
